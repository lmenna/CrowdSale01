Notes about how to run the UI for the ZepToken Crowdsale

I. Ethereum Smart Contracts
/Users/yglm/Documents/Development/Ethereum/react-truffle is the root directory for the project.
Run all smart contract related commands from the directory.

1) cd /Users/yglm/Documents/Development/Ethereum/react-truffle
2) ganache-cli --defaultBalanceEther 10000
3) truffle migrate --reset

Capture the following information.
1) Private key for first account listed when running ganache-cli needs to be imported into Metamask
2) Addresses of the ZepToken and ZepTokenCrowdsale need to be captured when doing the truffle migrate.

Notes:
1) The ZepTokenCrowdsale address seems to only show up in the ganache-cli log screen.
2) Metamask should be reset by connecting to rinkeby or ropsten then back to localhost 8545.


II. React UI
/Users/yglm/Documents/Development/Ethereum/react-truffle/client is the root directory for the UI.
1) cd /Users/yglm/Documents/Development/Ethereum/react-truffle/client
2) Open src/App.js and past the addresses for ZepToken and ZepTokenCrowdsale.  These were newly migrated is the steps above.
3) npm start dev
